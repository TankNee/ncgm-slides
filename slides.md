## Conclusion

Author proposed a novel graph-based method for heterogeneous table structure recognition through **intra-modality and inter-modality collaboration**.

Tests on various open data sets show the **effectiveness** of the method, and the importance of multi-modal cooperation for table structure identification.

**Limitations** include increased computational complexity and potential training collapse with deeper blocks. Future work can address these through refining the attention model.
