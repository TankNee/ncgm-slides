## Thinking about modalities collaboration

- What does ECE learn from the intra-modality?

Separate attention heads may learn to look for various relationships between inputs and introducing more sparsity and diversity for attention may improve performance and interpretability$^1$.

- How do different modalities collaborate with each other?
