## CCS Module

The Cross Context Synthesis module (CCS) fuses heterogeneous context graph embeddings collaboratively and learns collaborative patterns between different modalities. 

Specifically, it takes three modality inputs as queries, and the union of the other two modalities as keys and values inputs to enable query modality to fully learn information from the other two modalities.
